- [x] Messages works offline
- [x] Supports markdown
- [x] File transfering

### Why

- Most of the time you need to send important  messages or  transfer files between your pc and mobile.
- You don't need to have an extra phone number or email address to transfer files or messages.
- Messages work even when the app is not opened, which means, you can transfer important messages from your phone to pc or vice versa at any time. And later you can get those messages
- You don't need to spend your mobile data to transfer files between your pc. 
- When you are in the same network (i.e. Your Laptop or mobile connected to your mobile hotspot) file transfer works without using mobile data. So you can save your internet. 
- Not in the same network, no worries. It works, but standard data charges will apply.
- There is no limit in file transfer.
- Supports markdown, which means you can send rich text like fancy scrolling text, embedded images, etc.

    <summary>How can I find that file transfer is enabled?</summary>
 You can find a purple color dot near the profile of the user. When it is blue, it means file tranfer is not enabled. Wait sometime to turn blue dot to purple dot. It usually takes few seconds to turn into purple.
